# Introduction to React: Hands-On-Practice

## Step 1: Start with a mock, and break the UI into a component hierarchy

According to our [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) guide, before we actually code, we start with a **mock**. This is true for building React apps, but it is generally a good practice to create a mock before coding!

### What the mock?!

Why? Because creating a mock beforehand helps us avoid writing chaotic, spaghetti code. Because with the mock, we realize: 
* what components we need to implement
* the relationship and hierarchy between the components

Plus, with the mock, it is easy to split the User Interface (UI) into a component hierarchy.

### Explore the mock

Let's explore the mock:

We see that we have three components:

We have a parent component (red). It has a headline, and two child components:
* MarkdownInput (blue): It has an area where users can enter markdown
* HtmlOutput (green): It has an area that displays the entered markdown as HTML

This time, the mock was already created for you. In future, you should do it yourself. You can do it online on [draw.io](https://draw.io). Or you can use tools like [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for your desktop.

### Create component hierarchy

Based on the mock, we can create the following hierarchy of our React components:

Now that we know about the components and their relationship, let's go on to coding!
