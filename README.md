# Basic React Workshop

* **Event Name:** Thinking In React: Understand React's Basic Concepts and Gain Hands-On Experience!
* **Speaker:** [Walter Wallner](https://www.github.com/relwiwa)

## Description:
This workshop is an introduction to React's basic concepts. You will also start building the first of FreeCodeCamp's React challenges, the Markdown Previewer. For this, you will do pair-programming.

## Detailed Description:
### 1. Understanding (60 min.)
- The first part of the workshop will be an explanation of React's basic concepts (jsx, modules/components, state)
- Then a typical React workflow will be explained, following the guide [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) outlined in the React Documentation
### 2. Hands-On Practice (90 min.)
- The second part will be about start building your own React Application: [The Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer), the first React Project in the FreeCodeCamp Curriculum
- It will not be a copy and paste demonstration
- Instead, we will form pairs where a more experienced coder teams up with a less experienced one and you will build the application together
- We will use the [create-react-app Client](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can directly start using React without having to worry about any setup or configuration... or webpack ;-)
- There will be a tutorial prepared, that has step-by-step instructions on how to build the app
- I will be around to answer your questions
### Reflection (15 min.)
- The final part of the workshop will be us coming together again to share some of the problems encountered and insights gained while building the Markdown Previewer
