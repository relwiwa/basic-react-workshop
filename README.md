## Description:
In this meetup of FreeCodeCamp Lisbon there will be an introduction to React's basic concepts. You will also start building the first of FreeCodeCamp's React challenges, the Markdown Previewer. For this, you will do pair-programming.

## Detailed Description:
### 1. Understanding (60 min.)
- The first part of the workshop will be an explanation of React's basic concepts (modules/components, state, immutability, jsx)
- Then a typical React workflow will be explained, following the guide [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) outlined in the React Documentation
### 2. Hands-On Practice (90 min.)
- The second part will be about start building your own React Application: [The Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer), the first React Project in the FreeCodeCamp Curriculum
- It will not be a copy and paste demonstration
- Instead, we will form pairs where a more experienced coder teams up with a less experienced one and you will build the application together
- We will use the [create-react-app Client](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can directly start using React without having to worry about any setup or configuration... or webpack ;-)
- There will be a tutorial prepared, that has step-by-step instructions on how to build the app
- I will be around to answer your questions
### Reflection (15 min.)
- The final part of the workshop will be us coming together again to share some of the problems encountered and insights gained while building the Markdown Previewer
